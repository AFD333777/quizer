Which of the following statements about active link election in LACP mode is false?
The devices at both ends select the Actor based on the LACPDU.
The Actor selects an active interface based on the interface priority and interface number.
The Actor enables the active interface and disables the inactive interface. The Actor informs the peer of the election result through the physical interface status.
The non-active end determines its active interface based on the Actor election result.
