When using a one-armed router to implement inter-VLAN communication, sub-interfaces instead of physical interfaces are commonly used. Why?
Physical interfaces cannot be encapsulated with 802.1Q
Sub-interfaces has a faster forwarding speed
Sub-interfaces can save physical interfaces.
sub-interfaces can be configured with access interfaces or trunk interfaces

Which of the following statements about a Layer 3 switch is false?
Layer 3 switches can only forward packets at Layer 3 but cannot forward packets at Layer 2.
Layer 3 switches support routing and forwarding through VLANIF interfaces.
Layer 3 switch can forward both Layer 2 and Layer 3 packets.
Layer 3 switch can implement route forwarding through a Layer 3 physical interface.

Which of the following statements about routing and forwarding of Layer 3 switches is incorrect?
The Layer 3 switch finds that the destination MAC address of the data frame is the MAC address of its VLANIF interface and forwards the packet to the routing module for further processing.
If the routing module finds that the destination IP address is not the IP address of the local interface, it searches the routing table.
Based on the routing table, the Layer 3 switch directly forwards the packet to the next hop without re-encapsulating the data frame.
When a Layer 3 switch performs Layer 3 forwarding, the source and destination MAC addresses of packets need to be replaced.

By default, a sub-interface for VLAN tag termination is not enabled with ARP broadcast and cannot forward broadcast packets. To allow the sub-interface to forward broadcast packets, run the arp broadcast enable command on the sub-interface.
